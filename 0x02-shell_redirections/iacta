In most Unix-like systems, it is possible to create a special type of file called a named

pipe. Named pipes are used to create a connection between two processes and can be

used just like other types of files. They are not that popular, but theyâ€™re good to know

about.

There is a common programming architecture called client-server, which can make use of

a communication method such as named pipes, as well as other kinds of interprocess
communication such as network connections.
